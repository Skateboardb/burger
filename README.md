- Users input the names and/or descriptions of burgers they'd like to eat.

- Upon submit, the app sends the new burger info to the database and displays the name of the new juicy, delicious burger to the left side of the page just _waiting_ to be devoured.

- Upon devouration, "devour" status is changed in database from "false" to "true," and burger moves to right side of page with the rest of the discarded wrappers.
